Two Levels
===============

Game made for the global game jam (GGJ) 2014 by GGJ member 'jimmybob'.

DEPENDENCIES:
------------

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  * Python 2.x (tested with 2.7):     <http://www.python.org/>  
  * PyGame (tested with 1.9.2):     <http://www.pygame.org/>

RUNNING THE GAME:
----------------

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and type:

    $ python game.py

ABOUT THE THEME:
---------------

The theme of GGJ 2014 was '     '.

My take on the theme is provided by the 'switch' mechanism in the
game: we never quite see things how they are, we see them as 'we are'
(i.e. from our standpoint, or quite literally the block the player is
standing on in the level).

I've also incorporated the following 'diversifiers':
- Player character
- 

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
--------------------

[There is an in game tutorial so ideally there is no need to read this
section]

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the character.  Press spacebar
to jump.  Press the 'x' key to 'switch' the level.

Your aim in each level is to reach the portal (the glowing orange
circular object).  You'll need to avoid landing on the spikes though,
and this will require clever use

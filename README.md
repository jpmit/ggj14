Two Levels
===============

Game made for the global game jam (GGJ) 2014 by GGJ member 'jimmybob'.

DEPENDENCIES:
------------

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  * Python 2.x (tested with 2.7):     <http://www.python.org/>  
  * PyGame (tested with 1.9.2):     <http://www.pygame.org/>

RUNNING THE GAME:
----------------

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and type:

    $ python game.py

THE THEME:
---------------

The theme of GGJ 2014 was 'We don't see things as they are, we see
them as we are'.

My take on the theme is provided by the 'switch' mechanism in the
game: we never quite see things how they are--since there are always
two 'levels'---we see them as 'we are' (only one level, the one we are
currently on).

I've also tried to incorporate the following 'diversifiers':
- 'You Only Live Thrice'
- 'I am who I want to be'

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
--------------------

[There is an in game tutorial so in the first instance there is no
need to read this section.]

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the character.  Press
spacebar to jump.  Press the 'x' key to 'switch' the level.

Your aim in each level is to reach the portal (the glowing orange
circular object).  You'll need to avoid landing on the spikes though,
and this will require clever use of jumping and switching.

CONTROLLER:
----------

The game can be played with a USB gamepad, but unfortunately due to
time constraints I had to 'hard code' this in, hence the in-game
tutorial features keyboard controls only.

The controller I used is an inexpensive SNES like controller made by
'totalconsole' (purchased from Amazon).  So if you use one like this,
the game should work (A button for jump, shoulder buttons for switch).
It may well work with other controllers without modification, I have
no idea.  In any case it should be simple enough to make the
modifications to control.py for your gamepad.
